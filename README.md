# Hackathon_Calculator
 
 We as part of Team Tech Phantoms consisting of S.Sanjith Suriya,S.Navaneetha Krishnan,S.Sanjhay created a simple calculator project using kivy and kivymd
 
 There are two versions in this project,one is a simple calculator with basic Arithmetic operators(+,-,/,*)
 
 Another one is a complex one which includes all the other functions like trignometric,exponential and logarithimic functions
 
 We enjoyed participating in this hackathon as it was the first time learning app development for us.
